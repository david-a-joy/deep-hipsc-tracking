# Deep Tracking Toolbox for Analyzing hiPSC Colony Behavior

Use an ensemble of neural nets to segment the nuclei in stem cell colonies and
track their behavior over time.

## Installing

This script requires Python 3.8 or greater and several additional python packages.
It requires a CUDA enabled install of tensorflow >= 2.0 and a CUDA compatible GPU.
This code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, but may work with modifications on
other systems.

It is recommended to install and test the code in a virtual environment for
maximum reproducibility:

```{bash}
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/track_env
source ~/track_env/bin/activate
```

All commands below assume that `python3` and `pip3` refer to the binaries installed in
the virtual environment. Commands are executed from the base of the git repository
unless otherwise specified.

```{bash}
pip3 install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
pip3 install numpy cython

# Install the required packages
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Build and install all files in the deep hiPSC tracking package
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd scripts
```

Commands can then be run from the ``scripts`` directory of the git repository.

## Main scripts provided by the package

After installation, the following main script will be available:

* `deep_track.py`: Run the entire deep tracking pipeline starting from raw images

As well as individual stages of the pipeline:

1. `extract_frames.py`: Convert a movie to frames, optionally contrast correcting each image
2. `detect_cells.py`: Detect the cells in each frame using one of the CNNs
3. `composite_cells.py`: Composite the cell detections using optimized network weighting
4. `track_cells.py`: Convert sequences of detected cells to cell tracks
5. `mesh_cells.py`: Mesh detected cells to produce colony segmentations

Where each script is run from the current directory (e.g. `./deep_track.py`, etc)

## Training data, network weights, and example data

Sample data can be downloaded using the `download_data.py` script:

```{bash}
cd scripts
./download_data.py
```

This will create a folder under `deep_hipsc_tracking/data` with the following contents:

* `weights`: Trained neural network weights for the neural nets used in the paper
* `training_inverted`: Manually segmented training data using an inverted microscope
* `training_confocal`: Manually segmented training data using a confocal microscope
* `example_confocal`: An example confocal data set to test the installation on

To run the example segmentation pipeline, after downloading the data, run:

```{bash}
cd scripts
./deep_track.py --preset confocal ../deep_hipsc_tracking/data/example_confocal/
```

The various stages of the pipeline will run and produce outputs under
the `deep_hipsc_tracking/data/example_confocal/` folder:

* `Corrected/`: The contrast corrected individual frames from `extract_frames.py`
* `SingleCell-*/`: Single cell detections for each individual neural net, and the composite from `detect_cells.py` and `composite_cells.py` respectively
* `CellTracking-Composite/`: The merged cell tracks for each tile from `track_cells.py`
* `GridCellTracking-Composite/`: The meshed colony time series for each tile from `mesh_cells.py`

If the pipeline installed correctly, all folders should be created and the script should exit with `[DONE]`.

## Testing

The modules defined in `deep_hipsc_tracking` have a test suite that can be run
using the `pytest` package.

```{bash}
python3 -m pytest tests
```

## Documentation

Documentation for the scripts and individual modules can be built using the
`sphinx` package.

```{bash}
cd docs
make html
```

Documentation will then be available under `docs/_build/html/index.html`

## Cell Nuclei Annotation Tool

The cell nuclei annotation tool described in (Joy et al. 2020) is hosted in a
separate repository at https://github.com/david-a-joy/hipsc-cell-locator
